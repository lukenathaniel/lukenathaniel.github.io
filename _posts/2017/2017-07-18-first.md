To relax, you must first exert yourself. 

I can't relate to modern culture's obsession with being idle. To me, the word "vacation" connotes bourgeoisie comfort and laying around like a walrus. The notion of setting aside large blocks of time to _not_ get anything done fills me with anxiety.

**I have to be working.** It's my strength but also my weakness. 

Everyone has issues and to be candid, my need to identify the bare minimum and exceed it is probably about unfinished business. 

Ego compels good work all the time, but in my case it's not without some kind of toll. Having something to prove makes it really hard not to measure each day on the basis of what I've made of it. 

It also makes it hard to relate to some of the people I work with. As much as I care about them and their problems, I don't always understand their approach to life and work. 

What happens at 5PM that anyone can check out emotionally? 

Doesn't everyone begin each day as a quest to redeem the time they've been given?

How does anyone manage to separate what they do from who they are? 

After spending most of the last decade wrestling with these questions I've recently cried "uncle." Time and nature conspired to put me here, so maybe the natural thing to do is to abide. 

It may be the case that **my need to be busy is my subconscious playing a trick to compel me to create, build and produce.** I've studied other people long enough. At this point I should probably be creating more than I consume.
