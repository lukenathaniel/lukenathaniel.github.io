A first post seems like an appropriate place to talk about what has inspired me to write.

**I have to be working.** It's my strength and my weakness. I have little difficulty getting motivated to tackle tough projects, but then I find it hard not to measure each day on the basis of what I've made of it. 

I guess I can't relax without first exerting myself. 

I can't relate to the world's obsession with being idle. The word "vacation," to me, connotes bourgeoisie comfort and laying around like a walrus. The idea of setting aside large blocks of time to _not_ get anything done just makes me anxious.

Being this way also makes it hard for me to relate to people I work with. As much as I think I care about them and their problems, I don't always understand other people approach life and work. Work is always on my mind. How do they check out? 

How does anyone manage to separate what they do from who they are?

I've spent most of the last decade wrestling with that question and recently cried "uncle" because I just don't give a shit anymore.

At the ripe young age of 41 years, I've decided that **my need to be busy is my subconscious playing a trick to compel me to create, build and produce.** I've studied other people long enough. 

Now, I look forward now to creating more than I consume. I'll do my best to put good ideas and questions out there as I cast a net to try and engage others who might be making this same journey. 

Talk soon,
