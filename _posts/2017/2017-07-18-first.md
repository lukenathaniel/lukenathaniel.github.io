  On separating what you do from who you are

I can't relate to modern culture's obsession with being idle. To me, the word "vacation" connotes bourgeoisie comfort and laying around like a walrus. 

The notion of setting aside large blocks of time to _not_ get anything done fills me with anxiety.

**I have to be working.** It's my strength and my weakness. 

Everyone has issues, of course, and to be candid my need to keep my hands busy is probably about unfinished personal business.

Does having something to prove inspire better work? 

I hope so, but I'm not sure. What I am sure of is that I find it very hard not to measure each day on the basis of what I've made of it. 

## Who you are vs. what you do

Being this way make it hard to relate to people I work with. As much as I care about them and their problems, I confess I don't understand how they treat life and work as distinct.

I have trouble separating what I do all day from who I am. What do others experience at 5PM that allows them to "check out" emotionally? 

Or better yet - how does their day begin? Do they assume an identity with a temporary set of values and behaviors, just to get through the next 8 hours? 

I've spent most of the last decade wrestling with these questions, and I've recently cried "uncle." Time and nature conspired to make me the way I am, so maybe the right thing to do is to [abide](https://dictionarykiwi.com/2016/10/17/the-dude-abides-what-does-abide-mean-in-that-context/111/).

## White oak and silver maple

Trees provide a good example. Some trees tolerate poor soil and shade, and adapt by contorting and twisting to reach sunlight. They grow very large, very quickly, and after a torrid summer storm the ground is littered with their limbs.

Other trees require just the right balance of conditions to establish - the right soil, drainage and tons of direct sunlight. Those needs aren't as easily met, so individuals that survive kinda do their own thing for a few hundred years. Storms come and go, and these trees more or less maintain their shape and identity.

For me, following nature's example means approaching work with a sense of personal investment, and trying to stay true to that approach. 

The challenge, of course, is [balancing](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1219761-remain-true-to-yourself-but-move-ever-upward-toward-greater) the need to be a certain kind of person with the flexibility to let go, learn and grow along the way. 

It may be the case that restlessness or a need to be busy is the subconscious mind compelling you to act. In my case I think I've studied other people long enough, and at this point I should probably be creating more than I consume. 

If you're reading this, perhaps you are making a similar journey.
