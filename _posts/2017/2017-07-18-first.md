To relax, you must first exert yourself. 

I can't relate to modern culture's obsession with being idle. To me, the word "vacation" connotes bourgeoisie comfort and laying around like a walrus. The notion of setting aside large blocks of time to _not_ get anything done fills me with anxiety.

**I have to be working.** It's my strength but also my weakness. 

Everyone has issues, and to be candid my need to keep my hands busy and contribute something substantial is probably about unfinished business.

I like to think that having something to prove compels me to do better work, but I acknowledge it's not without consequences. It makes it really hard not to measure each day on the basis of what I've made of it. 

It also makes it hard to relate to some of the people I work with. As much as I care about them and their problems, I don't always understand their approach to life and work. 

How does anyone manage to separate what they do from who they are? 

What happens at 5PM that anyone can check out emotionally? 

Does their day begin with an assumed identity, a temporary set of values and behaviors conducive to surviving the next 8 hours?

How can people begin each day as anything but a quest to redeem the time they've been given?

After spending most of the last decade wrestling with these questions I've recently cried "uncle." Time and nature conspired to put me here, so maybe the natural thing to do is to abide impulse.

It may be the case that **my need to be busy is my subconscious playing a trick to compel me to create, build and produce.** I've studied other people long enough, and at this point I should probably be creating more than I consume. 

Perhaps you are making a similar journey. If so, I hope to talk to you soon.
