A first post seems like an appropriate place to talk about what has inspired me to write.

**I have to be working.** I have no problem getting motivated to tackle tough projects, but at the same time, it makes it hard not to measure each day on the basis of what I've made of it. 

Appparently I can't relax without first exerting myself.

Vacations, for example, make almost no sense to me. To quote my brother, the word vacation "...connotes bourgeoisie comfort and laying around like a walrus." The very notion of setting aside time specifically to _not_ get anything done just makes me anxious.

I think being this way also makes it hard for me to relate to others around me. As much as I think I care about people and their problems, I don't always understand them. 

How is work not personal? 

Where is the urgency to redeem each day?

How does anyone manage to separate what they do from who they are?

I've spent most of the last decade wrestling with that question. Recently, I've cried "uncle" because I just don't give a shit anymore.

At the ripe young age of 41 years, I've decided that **my need to be busy is my subconscious playing a trick to compel me to create, build and produce.** I've studied other people long enough. 

Now, I look forward now to creating more than I consume. I'll do my best to put good ideas and questions out there as I cast a net to try and engage others who might be making the same journey. 

Talk soon,
