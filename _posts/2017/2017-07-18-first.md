The word "vacation" used to make me think of bourgeoisie comfort and sitting around like a walrus, which is the last thing anyone needs. I'm happy when I'm working.

Everyone has issues. To be candid, my need to be productive probably about unfinished personal business. 

The notion of setting aside large blocks of time to _not_ get anything done used to fill me with anxiety. 

It took me years to understand the imbalance, and disruption of my regular routine had a restorative benefit.

I do know that I find it hard not to measure each day on the basis of what I've made of it. 

That, in turn, makes it hard for me to relate to some people I work with. As much as I care about them and their problems, I confess I don't understand how they treat life and work as distinct.

I have trouble separating what I do all day from who I am. What do others experience at 5PM that allows them to "check out" emotionally? 

Or better yet - how does their day begin? Do they assume an identity with a temporary set of values and behaviors, just to get through the next 8 hours? 

I've spent most of the last decade wrestling with these questions, and I've recently cried "uncle." Time and nature conspire to make us who we are, so maybe the right thing to do is to [abide](https://dictionarykiwi.com/2016/10/17/the-dude-abides-what-does-abide-mean-in-that-context/111/).

## White oak and silver maple

Nature has plent. Some species thrive in all kinds of condition, tolerating poor soil and transplantation and adapting to shade by contorting and twisting to reach toward the sun. They grow very large, very quickly, and after raging summer storms the ground is littered with their limbs.

Other trees require just the right balance of conditions to establish - the right soil, drainage and tons of direct sunlight. Those needs aren't as easily met, so individuals that survive kinda do their own thing for a few hundred years. Storms come and go, and these trees more or less maintain their shape and identity.

For me, following nature's example means approaching work with a sense of personal investment, and trying to stay true to that approach. 

The challenge, of course, is [balancing](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1219761-remain-true-to-yourself-but-move-ever-upward-toward-greater) the need to be a certain kind of person with the flexibility to let go, learn and grow along the way. 

It may be the case that restlessness is the subconscious compelling you to act. In my case I think I've studied other people long enough, and at this point I should probably be creating more than I consume. 

If you're reading this, perhaps you are making a similar journey.
