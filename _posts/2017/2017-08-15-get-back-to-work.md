Advice is a weird topic. Advice-givers get a bad rap, but I think the real problem is the advice-seeker's motive. We solicit advice, but then place parameters around the kind of feedback we want to hear.

Realization is a personal journey. Insight cannot be dictated or uploaded from without. It must be discovered.

Prescriptive advice leaves a lot less room discovery, and yet ironically I think that's why we sometimes seek *advice, and not feedback:*

_"I think I know what I need, but I'd like to hear it from someone else."_

Or so says the subsconscious. We're not even aware of the bias, at least I certainly wasn't. It took [x] for me to realize my humble quest for advice was kind of a navel-gazing charade.

Some of the most bracing feedback I received came from my late father-in-law, Bill, a Greek immigrant who spoke maybe 800 words of English and never stopped working until he died at the age of 95. 

##"You wanna spaghetti?"

I married into the rental property business. It wasn't much, maybe a dozen apartments total, but my father-in-law Bill had managed everything himself since retiring from the restaurant business some 25 years earlier. 

At 90 years old, he was still actively involved, though a recent stroke and failing eyesight had made it harder for him to be as hands-on as he wanted to be. 

Bill could delegate, though. He knew I worked from home, so my schedule was his for the taking. At least once or twice a week, I'd get a call: "How's go with you? You wanna spaghetti? Maybe bring the dogs, see Marijo." 

He always ulterior motive relating to the rental business. I'd sit down at the table for a meal with him, and then he'd ambush me with a pile of correspondence he needed help sorting. Vendor invoices, taxes, junk mail, etc. 

Frankly, I didn't mind. Bill needed the help, and I enjoyed the minor disruptions to my routine.

At the time I worked remotely for a mobile ad tech startup in NYC. I'd joined them as a freelancer, doing fixed-bid projects, but I hired on full-time shortly thereafter. I'd fly out to Manhattan every few months for face time, but otherwise worked from home - three blocks away, within Bill's easy reach.

During one such working dinner, Bill and I discussed the usual rental-related projects. It was now October, and winter was on Bill's mind. Each year, one of our building's flat roof had problems with ice dams, a problem we were going to fight preemptively this year by replacing the heat tape designed to keep our roof ice-free and draining properly. 

We tentatively agreed on a plan of action for the roof, and then Bill leaned back in his chair. "How's you job?" he asked. 

I assumed his switching gears meant we'd discussed the topic to his satisfaction.

The job was on my mind, in fact. We'd recently raised more funding and hired a slew of account managers and product managers, and I was feeling new and interesting pressure. I wasn't sure how to cope with it, or whether I wanted to at all.

I was dubious about sharing with Bill, though. Bill was a lot of things, but sensitive and sentimental was not one of them. I once saw him play solitaire as a depressed relative sat across the table from him, morose and stricken with anxiety. Bill paused his card game only long enough to look up and snap "You crazy, that's it!"

Against my better, judgement I shared my job worries with Bill.

To my surprise, Bill seemed interested. He leaned forward, nodding as I told him about the startup. 

We had grown from 12 people to 100+ in just two years. I was expected to commute more often to New York City. There was a lot of pressure, and I felt a little bit like I was in over my head. What if I couldn't hack it? Should I move out east and work in Manhattan? I wasn't ready for that life change.

Bill nodded again. 

I was surprised. I'd never known Bill to be the cry-on-my-shoulder type. For him to sit and hear my troubles caught me off guard, and so I was interested to hear his feedback.

And then, he spoke:

"I think so...better we check the heat tape they put'em on the roof...see if they no working. Hey, too easy we do 'em now!"

His response made it clear to me that he'd not heard a single word I'd just said.

And that, somehow, was exactly what I needed to hear, because I instantly felt better. 

Bill's mind was where mine should have been: not ruminating over shit I couldn't control, but focused on practical tasks facing us in the immediate future. 

##Want to hear vs. need to hear

Five years after Bill was struck down at age 95 by cancer, I still think of what I took away from his blunt, unfeeling response to my core dump:

Spend less energy worrying about shit you can't control
Focus your energy on practical matters right in front of you
Let your example serve as your advice

Feedback isn't a deliverable, but a result of the audience completing the circuit. It leaves dots to connect, and some negative space to ascribe meaning. 

What are some of the lessons you discovered?
