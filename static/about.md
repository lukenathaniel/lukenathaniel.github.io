I'm Luke Nathaniel Smith ([`@mrlukenathaniel`](https://github.com/lukenathaniel)) and this is my site. 

I do many things but mostly focus on what corporate America calls UX, design and project management. To me, these disciplines are very similar in that **progress has everything to do with how you approach working with other humans.** I'm very interested in this [concept of other people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qMf_rbydvg).

Accordingly, that's my angle. I can't think of a product failure that can't be traced back to some human failure to communicate (I'm still looking though.) In the meanwhile I'll try to write about the ones that can be, obvious and otherwise. 

I put this blog together using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using materials provided by Yegor Bugayenko  ([`@yegor256`](https://github.com/yegor256)). I recommend you follow him on Twitter.

**Thanks:**

You know who you are.
