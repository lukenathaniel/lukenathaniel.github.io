I'm Luke Nathaniel Smith ([`@mrlukenathaniel`](https://github.com/lukenathaniel)) and this is my site. 

I do many things but mostly focus on design, user research and project management. To me, these disciplines are very similar in that **progress has everything to do with how you approach working with other people.**

Accordingly, that's my angle. I think about project problems that can't be traced back to some human failure to communicate (I'm still looking) and try to write about ones that can be.

I put this blog together using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using materials provided by ([`@yegor256`](https://github.com/yegor256)). I recommend you follow him on Twitter.

**Thanks:**

You know who you are.
